# LAutopin -Lightweight Autopin-Based Cluster Health and Performance Monitor

This project is about a simple and pure tool to collect selected health and performance counters. It provides support for hardware sensors, such as cpu temperature and system fan speed, alongside with performance counters which are potentially meaningful for system reliablility and may be indication of pre-failure hardware state.
